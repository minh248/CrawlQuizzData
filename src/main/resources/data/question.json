    "question": "1. What gender are tortoiseshell cats?",
    "isMultipleChoiceQuestion": true,
    "explanation": "Approximately only one in 3000 tortoiseshell cats is male. This is because the orange colour featured in their coats is passed on through the female chromosome X. With XX chromosomes one is inactivated in every cell which results in the orange and another colour being present. In male cats with chromosome XY there is no inactivation which results in the fur being either entirely orange or having no orange pigment at all. Occasionally there is a male with XXY chromosomes which is tortoiseshell but these are mostly sterile.",

    "isMultipleChoiceQuestion": true,
    "explanation": "The first documented evidence of Persian cats is around 1620 when some were imported to Italy from Iran (then called Persia). The cats are distinctive for their long silky fur and their round faces and short muzzle. In the English speaking middle east they are known as Iranian cats, whilst in Iran they are Known as Shirazi cats. They are extremely popular for their beautiful long fur which may be pure white, golden or grey.",

    "explanation": "The Norwegian forest cat is one of the fluffiest and furriest breeds you will ever see. This is because they are adapted to a very cold climate with an outer coat of long fur and an under layer of short hair for insulation. It is thought that they were introduced into Norway by the Vikings in around 1000AD. This breed became nearly extinct during World War II, but in 1970 the Norwegian Forest Cat Club started an official breeding programme. They are now a very popular pet in Norway, Sweden, France and Iceland.",

    "explanation": "Cats need to eat meat to stay fit and healthy. It is also vital that they have a constant supply of fresh water, as cats can become very ill if they do not have enough water to drink. If you provide a litter tray for your pet the food and water bowls need to be well away from it. Some cats will not eat or drink if the food is too near to the litter tray. Cats normally know how much to eat to stay healthy, but if they overeat they become fat, and if they under eat they become thin, so the amount of food must be tailored to the individual needs of the cat. If problems are encountered with feeding a cat a vet will be able to give advice.",

    "isMultipleChoiceQuestion": true,
    "explanation": "Bengal cats were developed by selective breeding from hybrids of the Asian leopard cat with the domestic cat, backcrossed to domestic cats, to create a confident, healthy, and friendly cat with a coat similar to an exotic wild cat. Once separated by four generations from the original Asian leopard cat they become gentle friendly cats suitable to keep as household pets. Their fur is usually bright orange to light brown and they may exhibit stripes, spots or rosettes, with a light coloured belly. Their physique is similar to an Asian leopard cat. One of the advantages of such a cat is that they shed very little hair, although it is still advisable to groom them once a week to keep their coats healthy.",

Often as Amy practised playing her violin, Misty would join in with her meowing along. When during a visit by Carter grandson James Earl Carter IV, James would join them, he would clap and Misty would meow. It must have been terrible cacophony, and it was a wonder that Amy managed to practise her violin playing at all. Misty was devoted to Amy, loved to play with her and be petted and cuddled.

    "explanation": "It is a genetic mutation which has caused many Manx cats to have no tail, although there is a legend that it was late running to Noah\u0027s ark and Noah slammed the door and severed its tail. However Manx cats can be born with a full tail, a stub or no tail at all. They have both the gene for a tail and the one for no tail so a Manx cat can give birth to a kitten with a full length tail. However, if the kitten inherits the tailless gene from both parents it will normally die before birth. Manx cats come in many different colours and are characterised by their long muscular back legs. Koko the Gorilla who can sign over one thousand words of American sign language, was allowed to chose a kitten from a litter for her 12th birthday. She chose a small grey and white Manx cat which she named All Ball. Koko cuddled and played with All Ball regularly and was devastated when the kitten was killed in a road accident a few months later.",

    "isMultipleChoiceQuestion": true,

He left Fido with his barber and the dog was reportedly well cared for, and was seen snoozing in the barbershop for many years after he was parted from Lincoln. Five months after taking office, and just as the Civil War began, the Secretary of State, William Seward, gave the President the gift of two kittens which he named Tabby and Dixie. He became extremely fond of the two cats. During the civil war Lincoln was heard to remark \"Dixie is smarter than my whole cabinet! and further more she doesn\u0027t talk back\". During a formal dinner, Mrs. Lincoln was embarrassed to see her husband feeding Tabby with a gold fork. When she remonstrated with him he said that \"If the gold fork was good enough for ex President James Buchanan it was good enough for Tabby\".",

They are large muscular cats but well known for their extreme docility, and were given the name ragdoll because of their tendency to go limp when they are picked up. Some British breeders have been working towards making the cats less docile, as it is thought that it may not be in the best interest of the cats to be as meek as they are. Ragdoll cats have blue eyes and semi long hair which is very soft and silky. They get their full colour by the time they are approximately two years old, but their base colour is known by the time they are around 8 weeks old. They are usually born pure white and gain their points as they grow older. There are no standard colours, but they come in a wide range of pointed colours.",

Standing still will show the dog that you are unthreatening and the cat will be easy prey. If your cat is wearing a harness that fits snugly, he should not be able to get loose. First, you should try to back off as slowly and calmly as possible. If the cat continues to panic and the dog moves too close, spray the dog with water. Keep a water gun handy. If the dog does attack your cat, the safest thing to do is to release your cat. At least now he has the chance to run from the dog, and if you hold on to your cat chances are good that one or both of you will be bitten. Do not pick up your cat. The cat will only struggle and scratch. Let your cat run away and get help as soon as possible. Finally, as a last resort only -- meaning the dog is biting your cat and there is no one to help you -- grab the dog\u0027s back legs and lift them off the ground. He will not be able to run forward or bite you. That doesn\u0027t sound too tempting, does it?\nIf you meet a strange dog that only wants to make friends, but terrifies your cat, do as I mentioned above and just walk away. If you show you are uneasy, your cat will pick up on that. Once your kitty calms down, the dog will get bored and walk away. If your cat is frightened of leashed dogs, only walk her in private, fenced areas where it\u0027s guaranteed you won\u0027t meet any. Going for walks should be fun, right? Just to be on the safe side, never walk your cat in an area where dogs are allowed off-leash, or you are likely to meet a stray animal.\nDon\u0027t let what I\u0027ve said here discourage you. The chances that your cat will actually be attacked by a dog are very low. If your cat was well socialized as a kitten, he will most likely enjoy getting to see dogs!",

At six months, the cat is old enough to endure a long walk but young and impressionable enough to learn especially quickly. She is healthy and fully vaccinated, and if she was well socialized as a very young kitten she can easily be taught to ignore dogs.",

    "explanation": "Togo traveled with his team led by Edward Seppala 170 miles across Alaska just to pick up the serum and then made the 91 mile run to hand off the serum to the next musher in the relay. Although Balto is more readily remembered due to the fact he and his team under Gunnar Kaasen actually delivered the serum they had only traveled 53 miles in comparison to the total of 261 miles traveled by Seppala\u0027s team.\n\nOn a previous trip across Norton Sound Seppala and his team were marooned on an ice floe. Nearing land (but not close enough to gain purchase) Seppala picked up Togo wearing his harness and braces and threw him across the gap to land. Togo began to pull with the goal of bringing the ice floe close enough to land for Seppala and the team to cross. The lead snapped, which Seppala said denoted a death sentence. Togo taking the initiative jumped into the icy water and returned to land with the lead in his mouth. After rolling around to wrap the lead around himself Togo pulled the ice floe to land thereby saving Seppala and his team.*\n\n\n* An additional reference to the overall reference at the end of the quiz:\n\nSalisbury, Gay \u0026 Salisbury Laney (2003).
